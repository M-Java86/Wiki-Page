            <h3>What made me become a runner</h3>
            <p>
              When I was a kid I would literally always run. My family would
              always tell me "Michelle!! please stop running before you hurt
              yourself, just walk". When I turned 5 years old is my mom put me
              in track and field. I went on the run AAU track and field every
              summer. Once I got into highschool, I began placing at state
              levels and even got full ride scholarships for college.
              Fast-forward to today I still love running on a competitive level.
              I have 3 full marathons under my belt and I'm training for my 4th
              one. Running is my peace.

            <h3>Why I started Teaching</h3>
            <p>
              My interest in teaching began college. During the summer I would
              volunteer abroad to teach young learners english. After college I
              went back Aboard for three months to teach adults english.
              Teaching english to those who don't speak it became very inspiring
              for me. I was giving others a chance to make their way to America
              to get better education and jobs.

            <h3>I love Sneakers</h3>
            <p>
              My first love for sneakers was 7. My parents purchased me a pair
              Jordan 1 high top bred. Every since I have been become a sneaker
              collector. In 2019 I became tired with the way sneakers had been
              made. I felt like it was something missing. I sketched out a
              design shopped them around. My first design got picked up by a
              company names Alive shoes, located in Italy. By september 2019 my
              shoes were out of production and ready to sell. I sold out the
              first week and there after. I recently got them back in production
              and as of October 30th they are available for purchase.
