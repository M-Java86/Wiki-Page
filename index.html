            <h3>What made me become a runner</h3>
            <p>
              When I was a kid I would literally always run. My family would
              always tell me "Michelle!! please stop running before you hurt
              yourself, just walk". When I turned 5 years old is my mom put me
              in track and field. I went on the run AAU track and field every
              summer. Once I got into highschool, I began placing at state
              levels and even got full ride scholarships for college.
              Fast-forward to today I still love running on a competitive level.
              I have 3 full marathons under my belt and I'm training for my 4th
              one.
